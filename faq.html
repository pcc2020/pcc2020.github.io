          <h3>Who is the ePCC seminar series for?</h3>
          For PhD students and postdocs working in all areas of combinatorics,
          discrete mathematics and complexity theory. <br/><br/>

          <h3>Does my talk have to contain new results?</h3>
          No - talks that present partial results or provide an introduction to / survey of
          an area are also encouraged! <br/><br/>

          <h3>How long must my talk be?</h3>
          Your talk should last at least 20 minutes, though speakers have an
          hour slot that they may fill. <br/><br/>

          <h3>Will my talk be recorded?</h3>
          We will ask whether you would like your talk to be recorded and
          whether you would like the recording to be published. <br/><br/>

          <h3>Where can the recording of my talk be found?</h3>
          Given your permission, we will host a recording of your talk
          on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC18wYTjhetM0nL2q_jmKHMQ?view_as=subscriber">ePCC seminar YouTube channel</a>. <br/><br/>

TITLE: An introduction to External Difference Families and Strong External
Difference Families, and their applications to cryptography

ABSTRACT: This talk will introduce External Difference Families (EDFs); a type
of combinatorial structure consisting of disjoint subsets of a group G, such
that each element occurs exactly lambda times as a difference between elements
of distinct sets. Strong External Difference Families (SEDFs) will also be
introduced; these are EDFs with extra constraints on the exact number of times
that each element must occur as a difference between particular sets.  We will
cover some basic constructions of both structure's and briefly explore their
applications to cryptography.

TITLE: A survey on even-hole-free graphs

ABSTRACT: A graph is even-hole-free if it does not contain any hole of even
length as an induced subgraph (induced means the subgraph is obtained by
deleting vertices). The first major structural study of the class of
even-hole-free graphs was done by Conforti, Cornuejols, Kapoor, and Vuskovic
(2002), and it attracts much attention lately. The study of this class was
initially motivated by perfect graphs since these two classes are closely
related. They have a similar decomposition theorem, and in fact, the
decomposition technique which was developed during the study of even-hole-free
graphs led to the proof of the celebrated Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture by
Chudnovsky, Seymour, Robinson, and Thomas (proved in 2002). The main open
questions in this class are whether graph coloring and maximum independent set
problems are polynomially solvable. In this talk, we will describe the
structural characterizations of even-hole-free graphs focusing on the width
parameters and their algorithmic consequences, and we will survey some prior
and new results related to the class. This talk is based on joint work with
Pierre Aboulker, Isolde Adler, Eun Jung Kim, Marcin Pilipczuk, Stephan
Thomasse, and Nicolas Trotignon.
